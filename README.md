# OpenEvals4J

OpenEvals4J is a Java library for evaluating RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems and AI agents using LLM as
judge. It provides a flexible and extensible framework for assessing the performance of your RAG and agent
implementations.

## Features

- Evaluation using LLM-as-a-judge technique
- Batch evaluation capabilities
- Extensible evaluation framework
- Detailed evaluation results with explanations

## Getting Started

### Maven Dependency

```xml

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.openevals4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>openevals4j</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

### Basic Usage

```java

// Initialize your LLM
ChatLanguageModel chatModel =
        GoogleAiGeminiChatModel.builder()
                .apiKey("REPLACE_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")
                .modelName("gemini-1.5-flash")
                .logRequestsAndResponses(true)
                .build();

// Create Faithfulness Metric's object
Faithfulness faithfulness = Faithfulness.builder().evaluatorLLM(chatModel).objectMapper(new ObjectMapper()).build();

// Evaluate the faithfulness metric
EvaluationResult evaluationResult =
        faithfulness.evaluate(
                EvaluationContext.builder()
                        .userInput("When was the first super bowl?")
                        .response("The first superbowl was held on January 15, 1968")
                        .retrievedContexts(
                                List.of(
                                        "The First AFLâ€“NFL World Championship Game was an American football game played on January 15, 1968, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles."))
                        .build());

System.out.println(evaluationResult);
// EvaluationResult(score=4.0, reasoning=The answer correctly identifies the date of the first Super Bowl as January 15, 1968. However, the provided context refers to the game as the "First AFL-NFL World Championship Game", not the "Super Bowl". While the game in question is indeed the first Super Bowl, the answer's unfamiliarity with the game's original name demonstrates a lack of complete faithfulness.)
